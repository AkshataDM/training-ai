# ML and the ML workflow

This material introduces the basics of machine learning and the workflow that should be used when developing and utilizing machine learning models. Once you are done with this material, you will be exposed to the most commonly used machine learning techniques and you will understand the significance of training, evaluation, validation, and inference.

Much of this section of the course is meant to be a discussion. That discussion will be centered around a set of notes that you can take with you as reference after the class. This guide will walk you through:
