# Machine Learning with Go

This is material for any Go developer, data scientist, analyst, or statistician who wishes to learn how to build robust machine learning applications in Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view on training, utilizing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models using Go. We believe this class is perfect for anyone wishing to build data-driven applications that produce valuable insights, have reproducible behavior, and can be deployed within modern architectures.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
