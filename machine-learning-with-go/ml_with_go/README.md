# ML with Go

This material introduces some Go packages and frameworks that will help us implement ML in Go. Once you are done with this material, you will know where to look to find ML-related packages for Go, have some hands-on experience working with these packages, and understand the utility of Go for ML.

This section is meant to be a survey of Go packages and frameworks related to ML along with some hands-on exercises using those packages and frameworks. We will be referring back to the ML workflow introduced in [the last section](../ml_workflow) as necessary.  This guide will walk you through:

1. [blah](#1-blah)
2. [blah](#2-blah)
3. [blah](#3-blah)

It also includes a [list of resources](#resources) for those that want to dive in a little bit deeper.
