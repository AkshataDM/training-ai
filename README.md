# AI Class/Training Materials

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom/video environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## Python-Based AI Workflows - From Notebook to Production Scale

This material is for intermediate-level data scientists, developers, data engineers, or researchers. Specifically, this material is for those who have some experience developing ML/AI models on sample data sets (maybe in Jupyter), but who might struggle to scale, deploy, and productionize their work. They need to understand which Python tools to use as they scale our workflows beyond the notebook, and they need to understand how to manage and distribute work on large data.
