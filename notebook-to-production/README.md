# Python-based workflows - from notebook to production

This material is for intermediate-level data scientists, developers, data engineers, or researchers. Specifically, this material is for those who have some experience developing ML/AI models on sample data sets (maybe in Jupyter), but who might struggle to scale, deploy, and productionize their work. They need to understand which Python tools to use as they scale our workflows beyond the notebook, and they need to understand how to manage and distribute work on large data.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

## Intro to productionizing ML/AI 

This material introduces some common pain points and pitfalls that people fall into when trying to productionize data science work. Once your are done with this material, you will understand what the common pain points are and the guiding principles that will help us overcome them.  the basic principles and procedures of rigorous data analysis and motivates the use of Go in this context.
